#StackSafe Organization
Welcome to the StackSafe organization! This readme provides an overview of our project, including an introduction and description of the project, a code section linking to the web application, documentation on Safe and Gnosis Chain, a link to a demo video, and a team presentation.

#Introduction
StackSafe is a blockchain-based platform that aims to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) by implementing the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) investment strategy. Our project provides users with a simple and automated way to invest in cryptocurrencies using DCA principles. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, users can mitigate the impact of market volatility and potentially achieve better long-term investment results.

#Project Description
StackSafe combines the power of smart contracts and decentralized exchanges to enable users to invest in cryptocurrencies using the DCA strategy. Our platform automates the investment process, allowing users to contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals regardless of the current market price. This approach helps users to build a diversified portfolio over time and reduces the risk associated with timing the market. StackSafe is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and accessible to both experienced and novice investors.

#Code
The code for our StackSafe web application is available in our Web App Repository. This repository contains the frontend and backend implementations, as well as the smart contracts that power our platform. Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute to the project, and provide feedback.
